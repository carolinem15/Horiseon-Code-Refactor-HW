# Horiseon Code Refactor Homework

## Description

This project is a code refactor of a website for a mock marketing company called Horiseon. Horiseon offers three main services: search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. Horiseon's main page also delineates three benefits of Horiseon services: lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. In the future, pages associated with the three services in the <nav> portion will be built to provide more information. Easy ways to take advantage of these services will be available in these webpages as well. Additionally, contact information will be provided at the bottom of the main page.

The purpose of this exercise is to better understand accessiblity standards and semantic HTML elements. To achieve this, I researched both of these topics and found lots of helpful information on the W3 Schools website. This research also led to better clarification of other related concepts such as comments, section tags, header tags, nav tags, and more. Now, I feel that I have a better grasp on what makes a legible and logical HTML/CSS structure.

## Installation

At present, this project requires several steps before the application is able to go live. First, pages must be built and linked to each of the links in the <nav> portion. Then, Horiseon must provide ways for users to access their services via Horiseon's website. Additionally, Horiseon should include a portfolio of examples from past clients and testimonies to build credibility.

## Usage

To navigate this site, each service in the top section of the page is a link that will take you to more specific information on Horiseon's services. When you scroll down past the background image, brief descriptions of Horiseon services are provided as well as copyright information in the footer.
